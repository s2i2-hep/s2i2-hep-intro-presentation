\frametitle{CWP as roadmap}

\begin{itemize}
\item The goal in 6 months is to produce ``Roadmap for HEP Software and 
Computing R\&D for the 2020s'' and respond both to the WLCG charge:
\item \url{http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/assets/CWP-Charge-HSF.pdf}
\item as the HSF goal of engaging more widely the HEP community (to everyone's mutual benefit).
\item We need to be clear about defining priorities for the projects we need, how we will be organized to accomplish the projects and how these things fit in a timeline (for the mid-2020s/HL-LHC era, but which runs through LHC Run 3 and other things in between)
\item This is not a full specification of computing models for all HEP experiments. For HL-LHC (CMS/Atlas), for example, that will happen in 2019-2020 in the computing TDRs.
\end{itemize}
