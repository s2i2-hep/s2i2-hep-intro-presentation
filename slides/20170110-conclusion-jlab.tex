\frametitle{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item We have a significant investment in software, it embodies the core of our intellectual property and the real cyberinfrastructure.
\item Significant challenges of scale, performance, technology and long term sustainability exist as we face the projects of the 2020s.
\item DIANA/HEP is a pilot project to understand how to build sustainable software and software communities
\item The LHC and wider HEP communities are also executing a planning process for medium/long term software and computing R\&D
\item The process should produce the ``Community White Paper'', a roadmap for HEP Software and Computing for the 2020s
\item In parallel we would like to investigate funding and collaboration possibilities for eventual projects and activities
\item Please consider participating in the CWP process, the WGs and the workshops (beginning with the HSF workshop SDSC/UCSD in January 2017) and to put forward ideas in white papers
\end{itemize}
