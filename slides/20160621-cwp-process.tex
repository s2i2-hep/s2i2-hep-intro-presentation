\frametitle{Community Roadmap Process - DRAFT, for discussion}

We propose a series of workshops over the next year to build the community roadmap:

\begin{itemize}
\item Organization of working groups with experiments by September.
\item A half-day (Sun 9 Nov) just before CHEP 
\item A ``kick-off'' workshop after CHEP and before Xmas (near CERN?)
\item Several dedicated ``topical'' workshops in Jan-Jun 2017 covering software required in the various areas:
\begin{itemize}
\item Detector Simulation, Triggering, Event Reconstruction and Visualization
\item Data Access and Management, Workflow and Resource Management
\item Physics generators, Data Analysis and Interpretation, Data and Software Preservation
\end{itemize}
\item A final workshop in summer 2017 (near CERN?)
\end{itemize}

We should build on existing community activities when possible (e.g.\ DPHEP, Reco Algorithms Forum/CTD, IML).
