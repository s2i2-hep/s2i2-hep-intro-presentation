\frametitle{Software Scope}
\begin{itemize}
\item Note that ``software'' here is defined very broadly, not just in terms of (for example) the scope of the US-CMS and US-Atlas S\&C Ops programs. 
\item The next 3 slides contain a list of example software areas and challenges. This is probably not comprehensive and not all will be realizable with an $ S^2 I^2 $ (but perhaps they could be within the full HEP community)
\item If the font is too small to read, see pages 9-10 in \url{http://cern.ch/elmer/s2i2-2015-nsf-proposal.pdf}
\end{itemize}
