\item The CWP roadmap plan was presented and discussed at the HSF meeting at LAL-Orsay. It was generally agreed that this is a necessary next step.
\item The proposal for a community roadmap, to be carried out by HSF, was presented to the LHCC.
\item Ian Bird is now working with some of us to formulate a charge (for discussion) to kickstart this process.
