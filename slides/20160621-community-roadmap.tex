\frametitle{Community Roadmap for HEP S\&C}

\noindent As a next step for HSF and as a step towards software upgrades for HL-LHC, we are proposing a {\bf Community Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing}.  Such a community white paper should describe a global
vision for software and computing for the HL-LHC era and HEP in the 2020s;
this should include discussions of elements that are common to
the HEP community (LHC community, etc.) as a whole and those that are specific
to the individual experiments. It should also discuss the relationship of the 
common elements to the broader scientific computing communities.

This document could a step in the HL-LHC process over the next years and play a role in discussing possible funding scenaries for a ``software upgrade''.
