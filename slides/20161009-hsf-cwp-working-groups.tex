\frametitle{Practicalities: Charges for CWP Working Groups}


\begin{itemize} 
\item Over the next weeks we will be formulating charges for the CWP working groups.
\item Templates for drafting these charges are in google docs.
\item The overall WLCG HSF charge and links to individual WG charge google docs (in preparation) can be found at:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item {\color{blue} \url{http://bit.ly/2dcZZqa}}
   \end{itemize}
\item To view and/edit these charges you will need to be subscribed to:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item {\color{blue} \url{https://groups.google.com/forum/\#!forum/hsf-community-white-paper}}
   \end{itemize}
\item These google docs are just to draft the charges and allow people to self-organize and start discussions. Eventual proper documents (e.g. in latex) can switch elsewhere (e.g. github).
\end{itemize}
