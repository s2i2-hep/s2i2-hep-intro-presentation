\frametitle{Defining Longer-term Strategy}

\begin{itemize}
\item HL-LHC computing requires a major `software upgrade' and an eventual S2I2 institute for HEP would be a major player in that task
\item Planning for such an ``upgrade'' cannot be done for the US (Universities) in isolation
\item Thus we are intiating a larger community process to produce a Community White Paper (CWP) with an overall consensus strategy and roadmap for software and computing in HEP
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Initiated as WLCG charge to the LHC experiments and HSF as a step towards the LHC experiment TDRs in advance of HL-LHC
  \item The scope should not be restricted only to HL-LHC
  \item Some early software components could be built, tested and used by experiments in LHC Run3
  \end{itemize}
\item Organised by the HEP Software Foundation (HSF) [next slide]
\item Paper to be delivered by Summer 2017
\item The S2I2-HEP Strategic Plan will be derived from this global plan
\end{itemize}
