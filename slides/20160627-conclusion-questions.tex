\frametitle{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
\item What are your thoughts on this community roadmap proposal?
\item Do you see opportunities where such a process and document would fit with other national or international efforts?
\item Could a community roadmap (help, hinder) things you are already pursuing?
\item How do we put together a process to write a roadmap (document) over the next year?
\item Opportunities for extra resources may require common projects (Atlas, CMS, ...). How and where can we collaborate?
\item What should the roadmap actually look like?
\item What opportunities we can create and pursue which leverage both the process of putting together a community roadmap and the eventual roadmap document itself?
\end{itemize}
