\frametitle{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item There are a number of Software/Computing challenges to prepare for the HL-LHC era: scale, performance/cost, technology evolution and long term sustainability
\item We are working towards a ``software upgrade'' to address these challenges.
\item Over the next year a community roadmap (Community White Paper on Software and Computing, CWP) will be produced with a coherent roadmap for such an upgrade. This will be the basis for efforts to obtain/organize resources.
\item A handful of forward looking projects are underway today. We expect that over the next few years this will grow into the effort required to build the software required for the HL-LHC era in the 2020s.
\end{itemize}
