\frametitle{NSF SI2 Award Classes}

The NSF SI2 program includes three classes of awards:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Software Elements (SSE)} target small groups that will create and deploy robust software elements for which there is a demonstrated need that will advance one or more significant areas of science and engineering.

\item {\bf Software Frameworks (SSI)} target larger, {\em interdisciplinary} teams organized around the development and application of elements of common software infrastructure aimed at solving common research problems. These awards will result in sustainable community software frameworks serving a diverse community.

\item {\bf Scientific Software Innovation Institutes ($ S^2 I^2 $)} focus on the establishment of long-term hubs of excellence in software infrastructure and technologies, including elements and frameworks, that will serve a {\em research community of substantial size and disciplinary breadth}.
\end{itemize}
