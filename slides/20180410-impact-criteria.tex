\frametitle{S2I2-HEP Impact Criteria (for evaluating each WG topic)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Impact - Physics:} Will efforts in this area enable new approaches to computing and software that maximize, and could potentially radically extend, the physics reach of the detectors?
\item {\bf Impact - Resources:} Will efforts in this area achieve required improvements in software efficiency, scalability and performance and make use of the advances in CPU, storage and network technologies?
\item {\bf Impact - Sustainability:} Will efforts in this area guarantee the long term sustainability of the software through the lifetime of the HL-LHC?
\end{enumerate}
