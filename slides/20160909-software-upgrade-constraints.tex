\frametitle{Likely constraints to fund a ``Software Upgrade''}

It appears unlikely that significant increases in investments in software 
will be made by funding agencies purely from particle physics budgets 
and/or into individual experiments. Other opportunities do perhaps exist,
but often imply constraints, for example:

\begin{itemize}
\item Investments into software impacting multiple experiments 
\item Investments into development with impact beyond particle physics 
\item Investments into development permitting use of computing facilities (e.g. HPC) planned for other non-HEP purposes
\item Investments requiring collaborations with Computer Science or Industry
\end{itemize}

Building the LHC software in use today was possible without too many such constraints. The good news is that the community (with an existing LHC computing system) is better positioned today to make effective progress even with such constraints.
