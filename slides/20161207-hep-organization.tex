\frametitle{HEP Organization}

\begin{itemize}
\item HEP is organized at a global scale (``Big Science'') through experiments involving 100s to 1000s of invididuals. 
\item This can be daunting: how does one university group or grad student make an impact?
\item Building these large experiments has pushed HEP to create organizational structures that permit individuals to contribute.
\item The grad student will quickly and routinely wind up presenting to large groups of collaborators. Similarly, HEP has a footprint in 100+ computing centers around the world.
\item Other advantages: realistic computing/software problems at a large scale, relatively open academic culture.
\end{itemize}
