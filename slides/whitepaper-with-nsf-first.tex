\frametitle{Community White Paper (CWP)}

\noindent A Strategic Plan for an NSF Software Institute cannot be formulated without reference to DOE and international efforts. Thus the workshops and planning will engage the larger community with the aim of writing a {\bf Community White Paper (CWP)}.
\vskip 0.15in
\noindent The CWP should describe a global vision and roadmap for R\&D for 
software and computing 
for the HL-LHC era and HEP in the 2020s; this should include discussions of 
elements that are common to
the HEP community (LHC community, etc.) as a whole and those that are specific
to the individual experiments.
It should also discuss the relationship of the common elements
to the broader scientific computing communities.
