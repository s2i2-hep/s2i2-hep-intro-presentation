 \frametitle{Where does HSF go from here?}
The HSF was created 1.5 years ago as a means for organizing our community activities to address the challenges of future projects like the HL-HLC.
An initial set of collaborative activities have begun (see recent HSF workshop 
at LAL-Orsay). In this presentation I'd like to go back to a subset of the original objectives we had for HSF:

\begin{itemize}
\item Catalyze new common projects
\item Promote commonality and collaboration in new developments to make the most of limited resources
\item Provide a framework for attracting effort and support to S\&C common projects (new resources!)
\item Provide a structure to set priorities and goals for the work
\end{itemize}
