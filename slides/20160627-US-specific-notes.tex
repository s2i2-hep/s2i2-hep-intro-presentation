\frametitle{US Specific Notes}

\begin{itemize}
\item If we are aiming at a larger ``software upgrade'' project towards the HL-LHC, an additional ingredient is to find (or liberate) the resources to realize this roadmap. 
\item We need both initial exploratory R\&D and eventual development projects!
\item Both the NSF and the DOE have at least the notion of eventual resources and/or organization for new common projects in HEP (NSF: SI2, DOE: HEP CCE)
\item I'll talk about the NSF here as (a) I am involved in that part of the process and (b) the possible path indicated to us is a bit clearer
\end{itemize}
