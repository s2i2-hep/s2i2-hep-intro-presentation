\frametitle{S2I2 Strategic Plan}

%\vskip 0.15in
{\scriptsize
\noindent The product of a conceptualization award will be a strategic plan for enabling science and education through a sustained software infrastructure that will be freely available to the community, and will address the following elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item the science community and the specific grand challenge research questions that the $S^2 I^2$ will support;
\item {\color{blue} specific software elements and frameworks that are relevant to the community, the sustainability challenges that need to be addressed, and why addressing these challenges will be transformative;}
\item {\color{blue} the required organizational, personnel and management structures and operational processes;}
\item {\color{blue} appropriate software architectures and lifecycle processes, development, testing and deployment methodologies, validation and verification processes, end usability and interface considerations, and required infrastructure and technologies;}
\item the requirements and necessary mechanisms for human resource development, including integration of education and training, mentoring of students, postdoctoral fellows as well as software professionals, and proactively addressing diversity and broadening participation;
\item potential approaches for long-term sustainability of the software institute as well as the software; and
\item potential risks including risks associated with establishment and execution, necessary infrastructure and associated technologies, community engagement, and long-term sustainability.
\end{itemize}
}
%\noindent The strategic plan resulting from the conceptualization phase is expected to serve as the conceptual design upon which a subsequent $S^2 I^2$ Implementation proposal could be based.
