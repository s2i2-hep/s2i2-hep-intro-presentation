\frametitle{A Software ``Upgrade'' for the HL-LHC?}

\begin{itemize}
\item The HL-LHC will provide 100 times the current data, with significantly increased data (pileup) and detector complexity.
\item Most of the current software, which defines our capabilities, was designed 15-20 years ago: there are many software sustainability challenges 
\item Estimates of computing needs run faster than Moore's Law by factors of 3-30(?), but technology change will also make it challenging to exploit Moore's Law without software evolution.
%\item The U.S. DOE and NSF (for which I have numbers) jointly invest $\sim$ \$35M/year in ATLAS and CMS software and computing, with about half in hardware/operations and half in software professionals. The LHC funding agencies, worldwide, presumably invest o(\$150M/year) in these enterprises.
\item Over the past 2 years we have put the HEP Software Foundation (HSF) in place as an umbrella for activities to address these issues.
\end{itemize}
