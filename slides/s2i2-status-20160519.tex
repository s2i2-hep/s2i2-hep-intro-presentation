\frametitle{$ S^2 I^2 $ Conceptualization Status}

\begin{itemize}
\item We were told a couple of months ago that the $ S^2 I^2 $ Conceptualization proposal would be recommended for funding
\item It funds a fraction of the time of P.Elmer, M.Neubauer and M.Sokoloff to organize the conceptualization activity, plus participant funds to bring people to workshops
\item We have not yet received the awards for this $ S^2 I^2 $ Conceptualization, but we are nonetheless beginning some initial broader discussions about how to actually organize it in practice (in this meeting and others)
\end{itemize}
