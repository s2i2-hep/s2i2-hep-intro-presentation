\frametitle{S2I2-HEP Strategic Plan (from our proposal)} 

This will include agency specific discussions which are not (necessarily) 
relevant to the large community; topics will include:
 \begin{itemize}
   \item
     where does the U.S.\ university community already have
     expertise and important leadership roles;
   \item
     which software elements/frameworks would provide
     the best educational/training opportunities
     for students and postdoctoral fellows;
   \item
     what  types of programs (short courses, short-term
     fellowships, long-term fellowships, etc.)
     might enhance the educational
     reach of an $ S^2 I^2 $;
   \item
     possible organizational, personnel and management
     structures and operational processes;
    \item
     how the investment in an $ S^2 I^2 $ can be judged
     and how the investment can be sustained
     to assure the scientific goals of the HL-LHC.
 \end{itemize}
