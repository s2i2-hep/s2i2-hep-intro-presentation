\frametitle{Goals of the SDSC HSF Workshop - WG Challenges}

\begin{itemize}
\item For each working it is important to specify clearly the challenges we see in the medium/term. We see three possibility categories:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item to achieve improvements in software efficiency, scalability and performance and to make use of the advances in CPU, storage and network technologies
   \item to enable new approaches to computing and software that could radically extend the physics reach of the detectors
   \item to ensure the long term sustainability of the software through the lifetime of the HL-LHC
   \end{itemize}
\item Which of these is relevant for each WG and how?
\item What will happen in the WGs area if nothing is done?
\end{itemize}
