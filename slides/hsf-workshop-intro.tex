 \frametitle{Where does HSF go from here?}
 Pere has just described the current status of the HSF and the activities that have been taking place in the past $\sim1.5$ years. In this presentation I'd like to go back to a subset of the original objectives he listed:

\begin{itemize}
\item Catalyze new common projects
\item Promote commonality and collaboration in new developments to make the most of limited resources
\item Provide a framework for attracting effort and support to S\&C common projects (new resources!)
\item Provide a structure to set priorities and goals for the work
\end{itemize}

and in particular the next steps we could make.
