The proposal for a general Community Roadmap has been widely discussed with all of the LHC experiments and the HEP Software Foundation (HSF). There is broad support for the idea. \\
\vskip 0.1in
The CWP roadmap plan, to be carried out by HSF, was presented to the LHCC. It fits with the current notion of HL-LHC computing TDRs in $\sim$2019-2020.\\
\vskip 0.1in
WLCG has produced a charge for this CWP to the HSF and the LHC experiments (see separate link) with an aim to complete it by the end of August, 2017. \\
\vskip 0.1in
The HSF has begun the process of organizing working groups, engaging HEP beyond the LHC experiments and planning for dedicated workshops. Sessions at existing meetings can also be used when possible. \\
