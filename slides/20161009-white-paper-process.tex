\frametitle{Practicalities: Documents}

\begin{itemize}
\item The end goal here is a single CWP roadmap for the community. 
\item The first step is building working groups and defining specific charges
\item The process of putting together the CWP should generate a series of narrower topical documents from the working groups. (Much like the Snowmass process, for example.)
\item Existing public documents are something we will build upon, e.g. the Snowmass Computing documents, the DOE HEP-CCE documents, the WLCG Run2 Computing Model Update, the CERN Openlab whitepaper, etc.
\item The specific mechanics of assembling the CWP document itself will be defined at the Jan2017 SDSC HSF CWP workshop
