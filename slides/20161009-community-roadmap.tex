\frametitle{Defining Longer-term Strategy}

\begin{itemize}
\item HL-LHC computing requires a major `software upgrade'
\item A Community White Paper (CWP) on the overall strategy and roadmap 
for software and computing has been proposed
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Initiated as WLCG charge to the LHC experiments and HSF as a step towards the LHC experiment TDRs in advance of HL-LHC
  \item The scope should not be restricted only to HL-LHC
  \item Some early software components could be built, tested and used by experiments in LHC Run3
  \end{itemize}
\item Organised by the HEP Software Foundation (HSF)
\item Paper to be delivered by Summer 2017
\item It should play a role in discussing possible funding scenaries for a ``software upgrade''.
\end{itemize}
