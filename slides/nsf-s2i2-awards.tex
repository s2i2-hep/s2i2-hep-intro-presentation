NSF SI2-S2I2 includes two subclasses of awards:
\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{Conceptualization Awards} - which are planning awards aimed at organizing an interdisciplinary community and understanding their software requirements and challenges (\$500k, 1-2 years)
\item \underline{Implementation Awards} - which will be made to implement community activities that support software infrastructure, for example, such as those developed by the conceptualization awards (\$3-5M/year, 5 years)
\item The first solicitation for implementation proposals was last June; we anticipate announcements of these awards shortly.

\end{itemize}

We submitted a conceptualization proposal to NSF last August (2015):
\begin{itemize}
\item Conceptualization of an $ S^2 I^2 $ Institute for High Energy Physics
\item \url{http://cern.ch/elmer/s2i2-2015-nsf-proposal.pdf}
\end{itemize}
