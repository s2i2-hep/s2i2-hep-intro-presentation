We propose a series of workshops over the next year to build the community roadmap:

\begin{itemize}
\item A ``kick-off'' workshop, in the fall in the U.S.
\item Several dedicated ``topical'' workshops in the {fall, winter, spring} covering software required in the various areas:
\begin{itemize}
\item Detector Simulation, Triggering, Event Reconstruction and Visualization
\item Data Access and Management, Workflow and Resource Management
\item Physics generators, Data Analysis and Interpretation, Data and Software Preservation
\end{itemize}
\item A final workshop, probably next summer (near CERN?)
\end{itemize}

These should be HSF-branded workshops, should build on existing community activities when possible (e.g.\ DPHEP, Reco Algorithms Forum/CTD, IML) and should be supported by dedicated working groups.
