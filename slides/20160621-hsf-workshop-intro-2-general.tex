\frametitle{Where does HSF go from here?}

  The HSF has demonstrated some initial collaborative activities between people working on different experiments. However what is needed to address the future HEP software/computing challenges (HL-LHC and others) is additional dedicated resources for projects.
\vskip 0.15in
  There {\em are} a couple of ``common'' software-focused projects today which have acquired ``new'' resources: DIANA-HEP (http://diana-hep.org) and the software work package of AIDA2020. Neither of these was really proposed or funded ``as part of'' HSF, but they are the kinds of projects we want to foster under the HSF umbrella. How concretely do we go about doing that?
\vskip 0.15in
Even more concretely: can we build something resembling a ``software upgrade'' project for HL-LHC?
