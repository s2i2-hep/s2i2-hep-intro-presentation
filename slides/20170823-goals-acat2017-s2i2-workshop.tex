\frametitle{Goals for this workshop}
\begin{itemize}
\item Reach consensus on a prioritization {high, medium, low} for possible S2I2-HEP focus areas, guided by the criteria
\item Reach consensus on a basic strawman S2I2-HEP organization and processes
\item Provide reference slides (or short-document) describing this consensus
\item Review/edit/update/finalize CWP WG documents
\end{itemize}

The primary goal of the S2I2-HEP conceptualization project is to prepare a strategic plan for a potential NSF Scientific Software Innovation Institute (S2I2) to develop software for experiments taking data in the "High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider" (HL-LHC) era in the 2020s.
