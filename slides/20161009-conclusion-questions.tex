\frametitle{Discussion questions}

\begin{itemize}
\item How can we best organize to produce a consensus roadmap for the Community White Paper? What is missing from the proposed process?
\item How can we best address the three CWP goals?
   \begin{itemize}
   \item to achieve improvements in software efficiency, scalability and performance and to make use of the advances in CPU, storage and network technologies
   \item to enable new approaches to computing and software that could radically extend the physics reach of the detectors
   \item to ensure the long term sustainability of the software through the lifetime of the HL-LHC
   \end{itemize}
\item In practice how do we re-examine the organizational processes by which the HEP community and the experiments collaborate?
\item What opportunities do we have for funding a ``software upgrade'' to address these challenges?
\end{itemize}
