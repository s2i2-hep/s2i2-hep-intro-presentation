 \frametitle{HSF As Umbrella For HEP Community Activities}
The HEP Software Foundation (HSF) (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org) was created 1.5 years ago as a means for organizing our community to address the software challenges of future projects like the HL-HLC.
An initial set of collaborative activities have begun (see recent HSF workshop 
at LAL-Orsay). The HSF has the following objectives:

\begin{itemize}
\item Catalyze new common projects
\item Promote commonality and collaboration in new developments to make the most of limited resources
\item Provide a framework for attracting effort and support to S\&C common projects (new resources!)
\item Provide a structure to set priorities and goals for the work
\end{itemize}
