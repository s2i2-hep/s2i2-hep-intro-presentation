\frametitle{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item The LHC and wider HEP communities are executing a planning process for medium/long term software and computing R\&D
\item The process should produce the ``Community White Paper'', a roadmap for HEP Software and Computing for the 2020s
\item In parallel we would like to investigate funding and collaboration possibilities for eventual projects and activities
\item Please consider participating in the CWP process, the WGs and the workshops (beginning with the HSF workshop SDSC/UCSD in January 2017) and to put forward ideas in white papers
\item Note in particular the request for pre-SDSC workshop white papers by 15 Jan 2017
\end{itemize}
