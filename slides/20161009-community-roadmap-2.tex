\frametitle{Community White Paper (CWP)}

\begin{itemize}
\item The CWP should identify and prioritise the software research and development investments required:
   \begin{itemize} 
   \item to achieve improvements in software efficiency, scalability and performance and to make use of the advances in CPU, storage and network technologies
   \item to enable new approaches to computing and software that could radically extend the physics reach of the detectors
   \item to ensure the long term sustainability of the software through the lifetime of the HL-LHC
   \end{itemize} 
\vskip 0.15in
\item We need to engage the HEP community in this process through a series of workshops
   \begin{itemize} 
   \item Initiated as an HL-LHC planning process
   \item Aiming for a broader participation (LHC, neutrino program, Belle II, linear collider so far)
   \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
