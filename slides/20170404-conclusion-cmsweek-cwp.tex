\frametitle{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item We have a significant investment in software, it embodies the core of our intellectual property and the real cyberinfrastructure.
\item Significant challenges of scale, performance, technology and long term sustainability exist as we face the HL-LHC in the 2020s.
\item The Community White Paper should specify a roadmap for meeting these challenges for planned HEP projects, including CMS.
\item Is CMS contributing sufficiently to all areas of this CWP project?
\item ECoM2017 is synergistic with this. How do we kill both birds with one stone?
\end{itemize}
