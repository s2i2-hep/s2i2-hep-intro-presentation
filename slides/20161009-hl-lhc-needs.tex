\frametitle{Coping with HL-LHC Needs}

\begin{itemize}
\item To cope with the enormous expected computing demands for the HL-LHC, we have two solutions:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Invest in more computing: more hardware, more centers, ...
  \item Invest in better software
  \item or a combination of both
  \end{itemize}
\item What is ``better'' software?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Better algorithms, new ideas
  \item Better adapted to the current and future hardware architectures
  \item Better optimisations
  \item Better quality
  \item Better sustainability
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
