\frametitle{2nd S2I2 Workshop on HEP and CS Collaboration}

Welcome to the 2nd workshop on collaboration between High Energy 
Physics (HEP) and Computer Science (CS).
\vskip 0.15in
The first S2I2 HEP/CS workshop was held at UIUC/NCSA in Dec., 2016, see
\url{https://indico.cern.ch/event/575443/}.
\vskip 0.15in
This is one of a number of workshops taking place this year through the summer as part of the conceptualization project for a possible NSF ``Scientific Software Innovation Institute'' (S2I2) focused on HEP (\url{http://s2i2-hep.org}).
\vskip 0.15in
We have a mix of returning and new attendees as this workshop. So after
some logistical/introductory material, I will describe the S2I2 HEP 
conceptualization project, the challenges motivating this project (and an eventual Software Institute) and the current status.
