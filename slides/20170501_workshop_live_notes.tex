\frametitle{Google docs for live notes}

We have found it is useful to use a google doc to capture live notes during these workshops. 
\vskip 0.15in
See "Live Notes" on the workshop website (\url{https://indico.cern.ch/event/622920/}) for links to the google docs. You should join the S2I2-HEP google group in order to edit them.
\vskip 0.15in
There is one doc to use for the plenary session (Mon/Wed) and one google doc for each of the parallel sessions. Please feel free to contribute!
