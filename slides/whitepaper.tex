\frametitle{Community White Paper (CWP)}

\noindent A {\bf Community White Paper (CWP)} should describe a global
vision for software and computing for the HL-LHC era and HEP in the 2020s;
this should include discussions of elements that are common to
the HEP community (LHC community, etc.) as a whole and those that are specific
to the individual experiments.
It should also discuss the relationship of the common elements
to the broader scientific computing communities.
