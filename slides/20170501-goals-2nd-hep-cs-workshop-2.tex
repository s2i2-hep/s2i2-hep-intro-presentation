\frametitle{Goals for this workshop}
Although the general goal is to identify topics for possible HEP/CS research collaborations, we would like to call out some specific points in that direction:
\begin{itemize}
\item Are there places where the HEP language to describe a problem or system doesn't match how a CS person would describe the same problem?
\item Which things does the HEP community want to do, does not know how, and believes that Computer Scientists may be able to figure out?
\item How do these problems map to CS research questions?
\item Are there CS workshops/meetings on these questions which HEP people should consider attending?
\end{itemize}
