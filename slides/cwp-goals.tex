 \frametitle{What could an explicit CWP process support?}
Going back to the subset of HSF goals I listed earlier:

\begin{itemize}
\item Catalyze new common projects
\item Promote commonality and collaboration in new developments to make the most of limited resources
\item Provide a framework for attracting effort and support to S\&C common projects (new resources!)
\item Provide a structure to set priorities and goals for the work
\end{itemize}

The CWP process, an eventual CWP and (simultaneously) the pursuit of specific plans/proposals will support precisely these goals.
