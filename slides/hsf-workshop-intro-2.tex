  There {\em are} a couple of ``common'' software-focused projects today which have acquired ``new'' resources: DIANA-HEP and the software WP of AIDA2020. Neither of these was really proposed or funded ``as part of'' HSF, but they are the kinds of projects we want to foster under the HSF umbrella. How concretely do we go about doing that?
