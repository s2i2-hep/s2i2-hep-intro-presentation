\frametitle{A Software ``Upgrade'' for the HL-LHC?}

Looking forward to the next 10 years, we see a number of challenges for software and computing:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Scale:} The HL-LHC will provide 100 times the current data, with significantly increased data (pileup) and detector complexity.
\item {\bf Peformance/cost:} Estimates of computing needs run faster than Moore's Law by factors of 3-30
\item {\bf Technology/Market evolution:} the return of heterogeneity; technology change will also make it challenging to exploit Moore's Law without software evolution.
\item {\bf Sustaintability:} Most of the current software, which defines our capabilities, was designed 15-20 years ago: there are many software sustainability challenges.
\end{itemize}
