\frametitle{A Software ``Upgrade'' for HL-LHC and 2020s HEP?}

Looking forward to the next 10 years, we see a number of challenges for HEP software and computing:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Performance/cost:} Estimates of computing needs run faster than Moore's Law by factors of o(10)
\item {\bf Technology/Market evolution:} the return of heterogeneity; technology change will also make it challenging to exploit Moore's Law without software evolution.
\item {\bf Scale:} The HL-LHC will integrate 100 times the current data, with significantly increased data (pileup) and detector complexity.
\item {\bf Sustainability:} Most of the current software, which defines our capabilities, was designed 15-20 years ago: there are many software sustainability challenges.
\end{itemize}
