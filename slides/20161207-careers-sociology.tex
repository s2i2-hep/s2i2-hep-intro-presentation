\begin{itemize}
\item Before the LHC-era particle physicists would typically work on multiple experiments (with different configurations of people) in their career
\item Significant career incentives exist for people to stay within one of these experiments
\item Many examples over the past 10 years of career paths (grad to postdoc to faculty/staff) happen within one LHC experiment
