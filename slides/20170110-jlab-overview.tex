\frametitle{Overview}

In this presentation I will talk about several things:

\begin{itemize}
\item Software Challenges and Sustainability for HEP in the 2020s
\item The DIANA/HEP project
\item The S2I2-HEP ``Software Institute'' conceptualization project
\item The HEP Software Foundation and the ``Community White Paper'' roadmap project
\end{itemize}

I'll also explain the ways in which these are related...
