\frametitle{Where does HSF go from here?}

We should build on where we are with the HSF today.
The most direct fashion would be to prepare a {\bf\em community roadmap} for HEP Software and Computing. This type of document of course serves as the basis for discussions with funding agencies and subsequent specific proposals.
\vskip 0.15in

For example, in the U.S.\ the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel 
(P5) issued the {\em Strategic Plan for U.S. Particle Physics} in May 2015. This is the basis on which a number of projects are being pursued, including upgrades, experiments in preparation, etc..
\vskip 0.15in
The next obvious step for HEP S\&C to prepare for the challenges of the 2020s is to prepare such a community consensus document, and use it as the basis for discussions of resources with funding agencies, industry, etc. (We have such an 
opportunity with the US NSF, more on that later.)
