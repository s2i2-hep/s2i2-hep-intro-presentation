 \frametitle{Software Challenges at the HL-LHC}

\begin{itemize}
\item The process to define the computing and analysis models for the HL-LHC era has begun in recent years, with a handful of R\&D projects exploring various topics.
\item Given the 20 year time scale and physics goals of the HL-LHC, several major software sustainability challenges exist: 
(1) the evolution of computing hardware (processors,
storage, networks) and the need to find cost-effective solutions,
(2) increased complexity of the data %%  mds (due to higher pile-up)
and/or detectors, and (3) increased sophistication of analyses required
from larger datasets.
\item In order to achieve the HL-LHC physics goals, and do so at a acceptable
cost, we need a broad vision of software and computing in the HL-LHC era and an upgrade path to realize that vision.
\item In this presentation we present one possible path to achieve this.
\end{itemize}
