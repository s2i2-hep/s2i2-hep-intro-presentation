\frametitle{Goals of the SDSC HSF Workshop}

\begin{itemize}
\item Each Working Group (WG) should aim to produce two thing by the end of the workshop.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{A WG charge, specifying the scope, challenges and questions to be answered}
  \item \textbf{A plan for how the WG will work in the next 6 months: specific input to collect; videoconference meetings, workshops or workshop sessions planned, etc.}
  \end{enumerate}
\item The aim at this workshop is discussion focused on those two items, and not necessarily beginning the full process of gathering information.
\item Most of the action will take place in the parallel sessions.
\end{itemize}
