The primary goal of the S2I2-HEP conceptualization project (\url{http://s2i2-hep.org}) is to produce a well-defined strategy for R\&D for the software and computing models for use in high energy physics (HEP), in particular for the experiments collecting the very large data sets anticipated in the ``High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider'' (HL-LHC) era of the 2020s. \\

Specifically the S2I2-HEP project will identify potential areas where U.S. university personnel can lead in key areas of software development to help realize the full potential of the HL-LHC program. \\

However HEP and the LHC are global projects, so no long-term planning exercise can exist in isolation, thus we are also pursuing a wider HEP community roadmap for software and computing in the 2020s.
