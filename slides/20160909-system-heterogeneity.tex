\frametitle{Back to heterogeneous systems?}

Building the worldwide distributed LHC computing grid was largely made possible by the convergence on Linux on (commodity) Intel x86 processors around the year 2000. Building the WLCG at this scale in the heterogeneous workstation era would have been quite difficult. For better or for worse, heterogeneity is returning:

\begin{itemize}
\item Diversity of computing processor architectures (general purpose cores vs specialized processors)
\item Owned vs commercial/cloud providers
\item Some pressure to use systems traditionally designed for other types of applications (e.g.\ HPC/supercomputer as opposed to HTC/high-throughput systems)
\item Possible further commoditizing market pressures (e.g. mobile)
\end{itemize}
