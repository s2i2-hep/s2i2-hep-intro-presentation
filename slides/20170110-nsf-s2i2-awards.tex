NSF SI2-S2I2 includes two subclasses of awards:
\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{Conceptualization Awards} - which are planning awards aimed at organizing an interdisciplinary community and understanding their software requirements and challenges (\$500k, 1-2 years)
\item \underline{Implementation Awards} - which will be made to implement community activities that support software infrastructure, for example, such as those developed by the conceptualization awards (\$3-5M/year, 5 years)
\item NSF funded two software institute implementations last summer (2016):
