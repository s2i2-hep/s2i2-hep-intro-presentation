software infrastructure that will be freely available to the
community, and will address the following elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item the science community and the specific grand challenge research questions that the S2I2 will support;
\item specific software elements and frameworks that are relevant to the community, the sustainability challenges that need to be addressed, and why addressing these challenges will be transformative;
\item {\color{blue} appropriate software architectures and lifecycle processes, development, testing and deployment methodologies, validation and verification processes, end usability and interface considerations, and required infrastructure and technologies;}
\item the required organizational, personnel and management structures and operational processes;
\item {\color{blue} the requirements and necessary mechanisms for human resource development, including integration of education and training, mentoring of students, postdoctoral fellows as well as software professionals, and proactively addressing diversity and broadening participation;}
\item {\color{blue} potential approaches for long-term sustainability of the software institute as well as the software; and}
\item {\color{blue} potential risks including risks associated with establishment and execution, necessary infrastructure and associated technologies, community engagement, and long-term sustainability.}
