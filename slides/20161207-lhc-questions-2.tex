\frametitle{LHC Grand Challenge Research Questions}

Many fundamental questions remain, however, including: Why does nature express the symmetries embodied in the SM, and not other equally elegant symmetries? Why are there (only) three generations of basic building blocks of matter? Why are the masses of these building blocks so different from each other, both within a generation and between generations? What is the dark matter which pervades the Universe? Why is matter so dominant over antimatter in the Universe? Does space-time have additional symmetries or extend beyond the 3+1 dimensions of which we know? What mechanism stabilizes the Higgs mass from large quantum corrections at high energy? Are neutrinos their own anti-particles? Can gravity and quantum mechanics be described in a consistent theoretical framework?
