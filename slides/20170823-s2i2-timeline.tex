\frametitle{S2I2-HEP Strategic Plan - Timeline}

\begin{itemize}
\item The CWP (workshop) process culminated with the Annecy workshop at the end of June
\item The goal was to have a draft version of the WG white papers by end of July and a draft CWP by the end of August. This has shifted by at least one month. (August remains August!)
\item Goal is to produce $>$80\% version of the S2I2-HEP Strategic Plan by the end of October, sufficiently complete in the big picture that we can share it with NSF
\item What happens after that in terms of (a) solicitation(s) is up to NSF
\end{itemize}
