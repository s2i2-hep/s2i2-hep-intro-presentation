\fontsize{11pt}{7.2}\selectfont
%Implementing NSF's CIF21 Software Vision (NSF 12-113) is a Foundation-wide effort that includes multiple programs with the goal of nurturing, accelerating, and sustaining this critical mode of scientific progress. 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Capabilities:} Support the creation and maintenance of an innovative, integrated, reliable, sustainable and accessible software ecosystem providing new capabilities that advance and accelerate scientific inquiry and application at unprecedented complexity and scale.
\item {\bf Research:} Support the foundational research necessary to continue to efficiently advance scientific software, responding to new technological, algorithmic, and scientific advances.
\item {\bf Science:} Enable transformative, interdisciplinary, collaborative, science and engineering research and education through the use of advanced software and services.
\item {\bf Education:} Empower the current and future diverse workforce of scientists and engineers equipped with essential skills to use and develop software. Further, ensure that the software and services are effectively used in both the research and education process realizing new opportunities for teaching and outreach.
\item {\bf Policy:} Transform practice through new policies for software addressing challenges of academic culture, open dissemination and use, reproducibility and trust of data/models/ simulation, curation and sustainability, and that address issues of governance, citation, stewardship, and attribution of software authorship.
\end{itemize}
