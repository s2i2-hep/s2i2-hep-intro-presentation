\frametitle{Community Roadmap Process}

We propose a series of workshops over the next year to build the community roadmap:

\begin{itemize}
\item Initial presentation and organization began at the WLCG workshop and CHEP in October, 2016
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We are currently developing the WG charges and attracting interested individuals to the WGs
  \end{itemize}
\item A ``kick-off'' workshop at UC San Diego on 23-26 Jan 2017
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Start real work after a few months post-CHEP gestation in the WGs
  \item Discussions on more controversial topics, find path to consensus
  \item Develop plans and responsibilities for delivering white paper by summer 2017
  \end{itemize}
\item Possible ``topical'' workshops between Jan-Jun 2017, building on existing community activities when possible (e.g.\ DPHEP, Reco Algorithms Forum/CTD, IML)
\item A final workshop in summer 2017 (in Europe, near CERN?)
\end{itemize}
