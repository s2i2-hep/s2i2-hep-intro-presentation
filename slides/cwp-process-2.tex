\frametitle{Working groups - example questions to address}

In addition to addressing issues specific to a given topic,
each group should presumably address questions which cut across boundaries,
including:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  What are the specific challenges for the HL-LHC (IF, etc.)?
\item
  What opportunities exist to exploit new or advanced
  algorithms (e.g.\ deep learning)?
\item
  How can emerging architectures improve the bang-per-buck and what
  software evolution is needed to exploit them?
\item
  Which problems are specific to individual experiments and which
  are common to (for example) the HL-LHC experiments or to HEP
  and nuclear physics experiments
  more generally?
\item
  What is required to make common software packages sustainable?
\end{itemize}
