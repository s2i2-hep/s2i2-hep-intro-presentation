\frametitle{Practicalities: Contributing White Papers}

\begin{itemize}
\item The end goal here is a single CWP roadmap for the community. 
\item Along the way people are encouraged to put ideas on the table by submitting topical white papers. 
\item \url{http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/cwp-whitepapers.html}
\item Note in particular the request for contributed white papers on ``Computing Models, Facilities and Distributed Computing''
by 15 January, 2017
\item \url{http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/cwp/CWPWhitePaperSolicitation.pdf}
\item Existing public documents are also something we will build upon, e.g. the Snowmass Computing documents, the DOE HEP-CCE documents, the WLCG Run2 Computing Model Update, the CERN Openlab whitepaper, etc. Feel free to send links to these, too.
