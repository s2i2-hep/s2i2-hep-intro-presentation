\frametitle{Collaboration Challenges}

\begin{itemize}
\item The LHC and other HEP experiments cannot afford to undertake this software revolution independently
  \begin{itemize}
  \item There are many common software packages that would require common efforts, thus coordination
  \item General wish to increase the level of commonality and re-use
  \end{itemize}
\item Require the collaboration of the whole HEP community to ensure evolution and sustainability
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Show a common and coherent roadmap to funding agencies
  \item Establish structures to facilitate contributions to the HEP software stack 
  \end{itemize}
\item The adoption of a collective response will help to meet the challenges using available expertise and resources and within the required timeline
\end{itemize}
