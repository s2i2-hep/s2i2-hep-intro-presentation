\frametitle{Extra thoughts}

I made some set of (cryptic) notes as to what we did during our 
conceptualization that helped us. Many already seem integrated into this 
project, but several that aren't (yet) visible (food for thought):
\begin{itemize}
\item Design ``closed loop'' processes for meetings and workshops. Capture the vision. Publicize questions to answer from a meeting in advance and get those answers. Outcome-oriented. Designate people to drive/herd meetings, and to own the process of culling out the answers and agreements/disagreements. Iterate.
\item Clearly separate ``What'' from ``How'' in discussions. Agreeing on what a community wants to do (science driven) is as important as how it does it. The ``Vision'' is not the ``Work Plan''. (Blueprint)
\item Ask questions that encourage more than incrementalism. What if we actually had extra resources? 
\end{itemize}
