\begin{itemize}
\item From the WG plans produced in this meeting we will define the intermediate topical workshops and meetings which are required
\item We are aiming for a final general CWP workshop at the end of June or beginning of July. Several locations in Europe might be possible. We hope to pick one specific tentative date by the end of this workshop.
