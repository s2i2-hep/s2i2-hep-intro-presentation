\begin{itemize}
\item Data Intensive ANAlysis for High Energy Physics (DIANA/HEP)
\item The primary goal of DIANA/HEP is to develop state-of-the-art tools for experiments which acquire, reduce, and analyze petabytes of data.
\item DIANA is not a piece of software itself, but a collaborative project to improve and extend analysis tools as sustainable infrastructure for the community.
\item Funded by NSF ``Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation'' (SI2) program
\item 4-year project, $\sim$\$4M budget, 6-7FTE total
\item Princeton, NYU, UCincinnati, U.Nebraska-Lincoln
\item The PIs are involved in Atlas, CMS and LHCb
