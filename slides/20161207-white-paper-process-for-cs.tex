\frametitle{Practicalities: CWP Process}

\begin{itemize}
\item The end goal here is a single (consensus) CWP roadmap for the community. 
\item Finding consensus in a large community is a difficult task: broad participation and visibility/transparency are key elements
\item The process being used largely mirrors that used in the ``decadal survey'' process in high energy physics
\item Working groups self-organize, with encouragement from institutions and projects/experiments/etc.
\item A series of workshops is planned over about 9 months to allow topics to be explored, sometimes overloading CWP discussions onto preexisting meetingd
\item Contributions along the way can come in the form of ``white papers'' by individuals/groups/projects/institutions
\item Based on the ideas emerging from the discusions, workshops and white papers, a consensus CWP document will be written.
\end{itemize}
