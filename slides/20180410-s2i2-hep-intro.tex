\small{The primary goal of the S2I2-HEP conceptualization project is to prepare a strategic plan for a potential NSF Scientific Software Innovation Institute (S2I2) to develop software for experiments taking data in the ``High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider'' (HL-LHC) era in the 2020s.}

\small{S2I2-HEP sponsors community workshops and conceptual work to ``take advantage of the significant data and computing requirements of the Large Hadron Collider as a science driver for next generation high-performance software and sustainability developments.''}
