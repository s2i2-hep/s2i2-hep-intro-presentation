\frametitle{Possible routes to a ``Software Upgrade''}

\begin{itemize}
\item If we are aiming at a larger ``software upgrade'' project towards the HL-LHC, an additional ingredient is to find (or liberate/reallocate) the resources to realize this roadmap. 
\item We need both initial exploratory R\&D and eventual development projects!
\item In the US, both the NSF and the DOE have at least the notion of eventual resources and/or organization for new common projects in HEP (NSF: SI2, DOE: HEP CCE)
  \begin{itemize}
   \item The US NSF has funded a ``conceptualization'' (planning) project with a possible path towards a ``Software Institute''.
   \item The US DOE has seeded the ``Center for Computing Excellence'' with some initial resources. 
  \end{itemize}
\item We hope that a clear community roadmap will bring these and other partners together for an HL-LHC software upgrade.
\end{itemize}
