\frametitle{Documents}

In addition to the final deliverable(s) just described, the process of putting together these documents should generate a series of narrower topical documents from the working groups. (Much like the Snowmass process, for example.)
\vskip 0.15in
Existing public documents are something we will build upon, e.g. the Snowmass Computing documents, the DOE HEP-FCE documents, the WLCG Computing Model Update, the CERN Openlab whitepaper, etc.
\vskip 0.15in
New documents could be HSF Technical Notes.
