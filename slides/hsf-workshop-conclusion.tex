\frametitle{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
\item During this HSF workshop we would like to begin a discussion of the CWP roadmap document
\item How do we put together a process to write a CWP over the next year?
\item What should the CWP actually look like?
\item What opportunities we can create and pursue which leverage both the process of putting together a CWP and the eventual CWP itself?
\end{itemize}
