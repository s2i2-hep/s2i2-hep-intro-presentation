\begin{itemize}
\item The CWP roadmap plan was presented and discussed at the HSF meeting at LAL-Orsay. It was generally agreed that this is a necessary next step.
\item The CWP roadmap plan, to be carried out by HSF, was presented to the LHCC.
\item A CWP roadmap process (and the whitepaper itself) could fit nicely with the idea of computing TDRs from at least CMS and Atlas for HL-LHC in 2019.
\item Discussions with various partners/stakeholders are beginning.
\item We are now aiming for a ``kick-off'' workshop just before CHEP (expect to converge on dates by next week)
