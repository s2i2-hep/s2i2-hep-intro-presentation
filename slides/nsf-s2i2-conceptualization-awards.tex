\frametitle{$ S^2 I^2 $ Conceptualization Awards}

$ S^2 I^2 $ Conceptualization Awards are {\em planning} awards aimed at organizing an interdisciplinary community and understanding their software requirements and challenges. 
Example activities that may be undertaken as part of this award include focused workshops, special sessions at professional meetings, sandpits, focus groups, etc. 
%These awards will typically be 1 year in duration. 
\vskip 0.12in
The product of a conceptualization award will be a {\bf Strategic Plan} for enabling science and education through a sustained software infrastructure that will be freely available to the community. 
\vskip 0.12in
The Strategic Plan resulting from the conceptualization phase is expected to serve as the conceptual design upon which a subsequent $ S^2 I^2 $ Implementation proposal could be based.

Because an NSF effort cannot stand in isolation to DOE and international efforts, the process we proposed delivers also a broader {\bf Community White Paper}.
