\frametitle{Community White Paper (CWP) - Outline}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    a broad overview of the grand challenge science (HL-LHC, HEP);
  \item
    how new approaches to computing and software can enable and
    radically extend the physics reach of the detectors;
  \item
    what computing and software research will be required so that
    (for example) computing and software Technical Design Reports
    can be prepared several years before Run 4 of the LHC begins;
    this will include studies of hardware and software architectures
    and life-cycle processes and costs.
   \item
    identify specific software elements and frameworks that will
    be required for the HL-LHC era which can be built and tested
    during Run 3.
   \item
     organizational issues for the common software and for
     coordinating research of common interest, even when the
     final products will be specific to individual experiments.
  \item
     software development and documentation tools for
     writing sustainable software;
%  \item identifying and mitigating potential risks
\end{itemize}
