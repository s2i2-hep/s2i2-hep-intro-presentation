\frametitle{What is software sustainability?} 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Dependent Infrastructure:} Will the infrastructure element continue to provide the same functionality in the future, even when the other parts of the infrastructure on which the element relies change?
\item {\bf Collaborative Infrastructure} Can the element be combined with other elements to meet user needs, as both the collaborative elements and the individual elements change?
\item {\bf New Users:} Is the functionality and usability of the infrastructure element clearly explained to new users? Do users have a mechanism to ask questions and to learn about the element?
\item {\bf Existing Users:} Does the infrastructure element provide the functionality that current users want? Is it modular and adaptable so that it can meet the future needs of the users?
\item {\bf Science:} Does it incorporate and implement new science and theory as they develop?
\end{itemize}
