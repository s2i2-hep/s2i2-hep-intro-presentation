\frametitle{HEP Science Drivers - Beyond the ``Standard Model''}

The {\em Strategic Plan for U.S.\ Particle Physics} from May, 2014 (the
last community ``decadal survey'' and planning exercise for US HEP)
identified ``five compelling lines of inquiry that show 
great promise for discovery over the next 10 to 20 years.''
These are the Science Drivers:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Use the Higgs boson as a new tool for discovery
 \item Pursue the physics associated with neutrino mass
 \item Identify the new physics of dark matter
 \item Understand cosmic acceleration: dark matter and inflation
 \item Explore the unknown: new particles, interactions, and physical principles.
\end{itemize}
